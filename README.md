Bullet Hell 1 (due: 2016-03-10)
===
Make a bullet hell game featuring 1 extra/special boss common bullet pattern from a chosen Touhou game. This is part 1 of 2 (part 1 is group, part 2 is individual).

1. To aid it play testing, the player has infinite lives (scoring is based on how many times the player was hit)
2. Choose any player bullet pattern.
